# Real-time data pipeline for Gans⚡🛴
 
> A practical data engineering simulation to bridge the gap between static data and dynamic urban mobility
---
## 🎯 Project Overview 

**Gans**, an e-scooter company reimagining city transport, has found three key data streams as strong revenue drivers:

☔️ Weather conditions directly influence ridership and fleet distribution.
🛬 Flight activity reveals untapped demand near airports and transit hubs.
🗺️ Urban mobility patterns shape high-value zones across the city.

But how can these insights actually be transformed into real-time actions that boost revenue and efficiency?

This project presents a real-time data engineering solution designed to make that possible. It builds an automated data pipeline that continuously collects, processes, and updates live external data — such as weather forecasts and flight information — enabling Gans to adapt its operations to dynamic city conditions.

By integrating these diverse data streams, the pipeline transforms static insights into real-time intelligence, allowing for smarter scooter deployments, optimized fleet management, and data-driven revenue growth.

In essence, this repository is a hands-on implementation of modern ETL principles and real-time analytics, turning raw data into actionable insights — and ultimately, impactful business decisions.n essence, this project is a hands-on implementation of modern ETL principles and real-time analytics, turning raw data into actionable insights — and ultimately, revenue.
