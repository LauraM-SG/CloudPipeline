# Real-time data pipeline for Gans⚡🛴
 
> A practical data engineering simulation to bridge the gap between static data and dynamic urban mobility
---
## 🎯 Project Overview 

**Gans**, an e-scooter company reimagining city transport, faces a common but critical challenge:
*How can we use real-time external data to optimize scooter deployments in a constantly changing urban environment?*

While exploring Gans’s ecosystem, three key data streams emerged as strong revenue drivers:

☔️ Weather conditions directly influence ridership and fleet distribution.
🛬 Flight activity reveals untapped demand near airports and transit hubs.
🗺️ Urban mobility patterns shape high-value zones across the city.

The problem? Gans’s existing database is static — in a world where conditions shift minute by minute, that makes insights obsolete almost instantly.

This repository simulates a real-time data engineering solution designed to solve that problem. It builds an automated data pipeline that ingests and processes live external data sources — such as weather forecasts and flight information — to power smarter, faster business decisions.

In essence, this project is a hands-on application of modern ETL principles and real-time analytics, turning raw data into actionable insights — and ultimately, revenue.
